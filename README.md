# Shiny Cochlea

Shiny Cochlea is a `shiny` app written in `R` for visualization of transcriptomic data from the Green Lab at the University of Iowa. The currently available data are microarray data comparing gene expression from spiral ganglia from hearing and kanamycin-deafened rats. These data are published in: [Rahman, Bailey, Gansemer, et al. 2023](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp3.lib.umn.edu/36697994/). Genes that did not pass expression thresholds have been filtered out of this dataset. Please see the article for details on how the microarray data were collected and analyzed to obtain expression values. 

A version of the app with RNAseq data will be made available after publication of the relevant data.
